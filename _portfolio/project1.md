Low-rank adaptation in large language models refers to a technique used to efficiently fine-tune these models for specific downstream tasks while mitigating computational costs. By leveraging the inherent structure of the model's parameters and reducing their rank, low-rank adaptation enables quicker adaptation to new data without sacrificing performance. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where computational resources are limited or when rapid adaptation is required, such as in online learning or continual learning settings. By compressing the model's representation through low-rank approximation, it strikes a balance between adaptation speed and computational efficiency, making large language models more versatile and practical for real-world applications.
