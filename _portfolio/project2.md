The coverage problem in wireless sensor networks revolves around ensuring that the entire target area is adequately monitored or sensed by the deployed sensors. It encompasses various challenges, including optimizing sensor placement to minimize redundancy and maximize coverage, considering factors such as sensor sensing range, energy constraints, and environmental obstacles. Addressing the coverage problem is crucial for applications ranging from environmental monitoring to surveillance and infrastructure management. Researchers explore techniques such as deployment algorithms, scheduling protocols, and energy-efficient routing strategies to enhance coverage while conserving network resources. By tackling the coverage problem effectively, wireless sensor networks can fulfill their intended purpose of providing comprehensive and reliable monitoring capabilities in diverse environments.
