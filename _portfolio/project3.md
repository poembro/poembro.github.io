Personalization in federated learning is a key concept aimed at tailoring model updates to individual users' preferences and characteristics while preserving their privacy. Unlike traditional centralized approaches, federated learning allows models to be trained directly on users' devices, enabling personalized adjustments without sharing raw data. Through techniques such as federated averaging and client selection strategies, federated learning algorithms can prioritize user contributions based on their relevance to the overall model's performance. This personalized approach not only enhances user satisfaction and engagement but also ensures that the federated model reflects the diverse needs and preferences of its users. As privacy concerns continue to gain prominence, personalized federated learning represents a promising avenue for collaborative model training while safeguarding sensitive user information.
